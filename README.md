## Project Components
The Project takes an input hits an api that fetches the data from web hosted file and computes the frequency of occurence of words and returns the top n words with their count.

### View 
The view is built in an angular 5 component (app.component.ts) with a simple html number input and a table that displays the data returned by api

### API and Backend
The Api takes the input number from the parameter of the get request and routes the call to the respective controller.
The Controller then does an http request to the given URL and computes the frequency count for all the words and returns the top N words as per the request
